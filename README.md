# Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies

In preparation for my VKURA internship this summer, researching privacy-preserving auctions on the blockchain, I am completing the [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency) course from Princeton University.

The course includes three programming assignments, which I'll include here.

I've never actually used Java before, so this will be a fun experiment to see how my knowledge of C and Python transfer over.
